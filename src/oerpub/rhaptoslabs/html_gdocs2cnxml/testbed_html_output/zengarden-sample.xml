          <title>The Road to Enlightenment</title>
          <para>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible s, and broken  support.</para>
          <para>Today, we must clear the mind of past practices. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the ,  and the major browser creators.</para>

          <title>So What is This About?</title>
          <para>There is clearly a need for  to be taken seriously by graphic artists. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The code remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external .css file. Yes, really.</para>
          <para> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. To date, most examples of neat tricks and hacks have been demonstrated by structurists and coders. Designers have yet to make their mark. This needs to change.</para>

          <title>Participation</title>
          <para>Graphic artists only please. You are modifying this page, so strong  skills are necessary, but the example files are commented well enough that even  novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <link url="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/" window="new"> Resource Guide</link> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with .</para>
          <para>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the . This may seem daunting at first if you've never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</para>

          <title>Benefits</title>
          <para>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to when making the case for -based design. This is sorely needed, even today.

          <title>Requirements</title>
          <para>We would like to see as much  as possible.  should be limited to widely-supported elements only. The css Zen Garden is about functional, practical  and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your  validates.</para>
          <para>Unfortunately, designing this way highlights the flaws in the various implementations of . Different browsers display differently, even completely valid  at times, and this becomes maddening when a fix for one leads to breakage in another. View the <link url="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/" window="new">Resources</link> page for information on some of the fixes available. Full browser compliance is still sometimes a pipe dream, and we do not expect you to come up with pixel-perfect code across every platform. But do test in as many as you can. If your design doesn't work in at least IE5+/Win and Mozilla (run by over 90% of the population), chances are we won't accept it.</para>
          <para>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum; tasteful nudity is acceptable, outright pornography will be rejected.</para>
          <para>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <link url="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/" window="new">submission guidelines</link>), but we ask you release your  under a Creative Commons license identical to the <link url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/1.0/" window="new">one on this site</link> so that others may learn from your work.</para>
