      <title>Cultivation:Edit</title>
      <para id="gd-id1063792">Native to lowland tropical South America, cacao has been cultivated for three thousand years in Central America and Mexico, with its earliest documented use around 1100 BC. All of the Mesoamerican peoples made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as xocolƒÅtl, a Nahuatl word meaning "bitter water". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste, and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After being roasted and ground, the resulting products are known as chocolate or cocoa.</para>
